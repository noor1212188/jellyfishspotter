## Jellyfish_Identifyer

My project helps people who swim in the ocean often avoid dangerous stings from certain types of jellyfish. Some people may get startled by seeing a jellyfish in the water although they are not all harmful. My project helps identify which jellyfish might be harmful, and which jellyfish you don't have to worry about when you encounter it.

## The code

My code consists of numerous images of certain types of jellyfish from different datatypes. When you run the code it inserts a new file that shows someone whether the jellyfish they spotted is safe or dangerous.
